              <h4>About the project</h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  <b>MedicBot</b> is a virtual assistant that using Artificial Intelligence is capable to guide doctors through a conversational experience
                  to obtain all data necessary to generate the reports and prescription digitally using <a href="https://www.useanvil.com/">Anvil</a> technologies, and send
                  them to their emails. <br>
                  Also, <b>MedicBot</b> is able to detect any moment if the person who is talking with is the doctor
                  itself, through the bevahioral biometrics technologies of <a href="https://www.typingdna.com/">TypingDNA</a>. In case it detects something wrong, the doctor should enter its
                  password or no report will be generated.
              </p>
